# Namaste JavaScript

## SEASON - 1

### How JavaScript Works üî• & Execution Context | Namaste JavaScript Ep.1

"Everything in JavaScript happens inside an Execution Context."

We can assume this Execution Context to be a big box or a container in which the whole JavaScript code is executed.

Execution Context has 2 components/phases in it:

1) **Memory Component / Memory Creation Phase / Variable Environment**  
(It is the place where variables and function declarations are stored as key-value pairs.  
Functions are fully hoisted with their definitions, while variables are hoisted with an initial value of `undefined`.)

2) **Code Component / Code Execution Phase / Thread of Execution**  
(It is the place where code is executed one line at a time.)

---

"JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language by default."

It means that JavaScript can only execute one command at a time in a specific order. It also means that it can move to the next line only after the current line has finished executing.  
However, JavaScript can handle asynchronous operations using the event loop.
